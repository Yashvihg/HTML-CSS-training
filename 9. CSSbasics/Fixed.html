      There is your trouble right there. Two different CSS selectors are telling
      that text what color and font-weight to be. There is only one statement
      for font-size, so clearly that one will take effect. These aren’t
      “conflicts” per-say, but the browser does need to decide which one of
      these statements to honor. It does so by following a standard set of
      specificity rules.There is your trouble right there. Two different CSS

<!-- absolute depends on the position of the parent. WHEREAS, fixed relies on window. it positions according to window and not parent. s -->
<!-- absolute moves with the scroll -->
<!-- fixed doesnt move with scroll-->
these come out of the control flow of the code.
